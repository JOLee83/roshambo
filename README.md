<p style={margin:'0' '20%'}>This was the first project from my first week of learning <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> at SDG. This was also my first video game too. Checkout the game for yourself on <a href="http://roshambo-justin.surge.sh/">Surge</a>. It was struggle to get it to work, after hours of trying I decide to come back to it later, and when I got back to it, turns out all I was missing was to call the function; like this `function()`.</p>
<p>I also have future plans for this game that you can see in the commented out code below.</p>
